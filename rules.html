            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            
            <p>Get the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points. The ball will bounce off the paddles and the walls. To prevent the opponent from scoring, move your paddle with the left and right arrow keys to deflect the ball.</p>
            
            <p>Each round will start with the ball in the middle of the board. It will drop towards the player's paddle. The player must deflect the ball and bounce it to their opponent who will deflect it back.</p>
            
            <p>If at any point in the round either player misses a shot, the other player scored a goal and the next round will start.</p>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            
            <p>You will gain 100 points each time you deflect the ball successfully. Each time you score a goal, you will gain 1000 points. Each time your opponent scores a goal, you will loose 1000 points.</p>
            
            <p>However, you will not loose points for missing the first ball of each round.</p>

            <h2>Levels</h2>
            
            <p>Every 3000 points, you will advance one level. Each level brings with it new difficulties and challenges.</p>
